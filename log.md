# 100 Days Of Code - Log

This the future 100 days, I will study how to use python for data science. I will follow the book "Python for Data Analysis" to achieve my goal.

### Day 1: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read the chapter 2 and try all the code proposed by the book.

**Thoughts:** This chapiter is very simple. But I also use 2 hours to finish it.

### Day 2: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read the first section of chapter 3 and try all the code proposed by the book. Today, I can not be absorbed in programming. Normally I hope I can finish this chapiter today, but my worh is behind my expected.

**Thoughts:** I am tired and sick. I think I need more power.

### Day 2: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read the rest  of chapter 3 and try all the code proposed by the book. There is no difficulty in this chapter.

**Thoughts:** I am always tired and sick.
