# 100 Days Of Code - Log

This the future 100 days, I will study how to use python for data science. I will follow the book "Python for Data Analysis" to achieve my goal.

### Day 1: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read the chapter 2 and try all the code proposed by the book.

**Thoughts:** This chapiter is very simple. But I also use 2 hours to finish it.
