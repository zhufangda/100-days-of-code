# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
September 19th, 2019.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code for the homework, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)

3. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.

4. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
